# computational-statistics
 
 Collection of notebooks implementing statistical algorithms from scratch. Some based on STAT 525 HWs at UIUC.
 
 Convex programming algorithms implemented:
 
 - Vanilla gradient descent
 - Projected gradient descent
 - Frank-Wolfe 
 - Proximal gradient descent
 - Coordinate descent
 - ADMM
 - Dual proximal gradient descent
 - TODO: Stochastic gradient descent
 - TODO: Stochastic variance reduced gradient descent
 
 Applications:
 
 - Matrix completion
 - $l_1$ mean-filtering (total-variation denoising)
 - PCA
 - AdaBoost
